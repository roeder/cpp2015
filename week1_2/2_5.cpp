/* The inverse of a square matrix of size 2 is given in Sect. A.1.3.
 *
 * 1. Write code to calculate the inverse of the matrix given by A = {{4, 10},{1, 1}}
 * 2. Check that the inverse calculated is correct by printing out the entries of the inverse, and comparing
 * with direct calculation.
 * 3. Modify your code to include an assert statement that checks that the determinant of the matrix is nonzero.
