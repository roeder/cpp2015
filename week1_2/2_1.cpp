/*
Below is an example fragment of code that uses several features introduced in this chapter. The variables x, y and z
 are all double precision floating point variables.*/

//double x, y, z;
//if ((x > y) || (x < 5.0)) {
//    z = 4.0; }
//else
//{
//    z = 2.0;
//}

/*
1. Explain, in words, what the fragment of code does.
2. What value would the fragment of code assign to the variable z when the vari-
ables x and y take the following values: (a) x=10.0, and y=-1.0;
(b) x=10.0, and y=20.0; and
(c) x=0.0, and y=20.0.
