/*
I want to record the number of cars that drive past my house each day for five consecutive days, and calculate the
average of these numbers. Create an integer array to store these five numbers, and then write code to calculate the
 average of these numbers. Execute your code using the sample data 34, 58, 57, 32, 43. Verify that you get the
 correct answer of 44.8.
 Hint: read the material in Sect. 1.4.4 on converting integers to double precision floating point numbers.
