p11 S1.4.1
Published:
However, it may be mistakenly read to be
1   int row = 1, column = 2;
2   ( row = column ) = 3;
after which row would take the value 2 (which is the initial value of
column), and column would take the value 3.
Should read:
However, it may be mistakenly read to be
1   int row = 1, column = 2;
2   ( row = column ) = 3;
during which row would first take the value 2 (which is the initial value of
column), and then row (the result of the assignment ( row = column)) would
take the value 3.  The value of column is unaffected.

Another advantage of assert statements is that they are automatically
removed when compiled with the ``-O'' optimisation flag
Should read:
Another advantage of assert statements is that they can be automatically
removed when compiled with the certain flags
(The necessary flag is -DNDEBUG, which may be set by an optimisation flag 
in some compilers.

Published:
The condition which is actually tested is whether or not the assignment is
successful.  The assignment will be successful, and so this condition is met.
Should read:
The condition which is actually tested is obtained from the value of the
assignment.  A non-zero value is interpreted as success, and so this
condition is met.
